Data was obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA). Two data files were retrieved from NOAA. The first dataset obtained was
a survey of the populations of fish in the waters around St. John, the smallest
of the three U.S. Virgin Islands. The second dataset obtained was a survey of
the populations of coral in the waters around St. John. Some of the data in the
dataset includes, but is not limited to, the habitat these marine organisms were
found in, the species of the organisms, and the amount of coral observed to be
dead or infected with disease.

The two datasets contained common columns, and the pandas library was utilized
to join the two datasets on these common columns. The end result is a single
table that makes parsing the data somewhat easier without the need to reference
data from multiple datasets.
